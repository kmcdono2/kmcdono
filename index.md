I am a Lecturer in Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Lancaster University and also a Senior Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute in London, UK. 

My first book manuscript *Public Work: Making Roads and Citizens in Eighteenth-Century France* examines unsuccessful socio-economic and political reforms related to infrastructure development in pre-Revolutionary France. 

My digital work uses computational image, text, and spatial analysis to create new ways of doing historical research with large library and archival collections as data. I lead the [MapReader](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) project, a software library for analyzing the visual and textual content of historical maps. 

I completed my PhD in History at Stanford University. Please see [my profile at Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/history/about/people/katherine-mcdonough) for more details.

## Teaching

At Lancaster I teach early modern and modern French history at the undergraduate level and digital humanities at the postgraduate level. Recent courses include "Spatial Technologies for Humanities Research" and "Digital Texts in the Humanities".

I also regularly teach workshops on using computational methods in historical research, especially for maps, newspapers, and encyclopedias.

Previously, I have taught survey courses on early modern European history, world history, and the history of science and technology. I have also taught advanced undergraduate seminars on the French Enlightenment and Revolution, nature and empire in the early modern world, French peasants, and the history of maps and mapping.
