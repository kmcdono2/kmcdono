I am a Lecturer in Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Lancaster University and also a Senior Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute in London, UK. 

I am a historian of eighteenth-century France and a specialist in the spatial digital humanities. My interests lie in the connected histories of ideas, information, and infrastructure. In my digital research, I have focused on developing new methods to examine spatial information in maps, newspapers, and encyclopedias. Between 2019-2023, I was part of the Living with Machines team in London, where I used national-scale collections of maps and newspapers to investigate British history in the long nineteenth century. 

My first monograph, *Public Work: Making Roads and Citizens in Eighteenth-Century France*, examples unsuccessful socio-economic reform related to infrastructure development in pre-Revolutionary France. Public Work tells the history of the corvée, e.g. the forced labour regime used on highway construction sites ca. 1730 to 1790, as seen from the perspective of the peasants, engineers, and administrators building highways in Brittany. I argue that Breton peasants and some elites used different information technologies to contest the coercive corvée and reimagine provincial government in terms of democratic public utility, all while centralized solutions to the injustice of the corvée failed across the kingdom. 

I lead the [MapReader](https://github.com/maps-as-data/MapReader) project, a software library for analyzing the visual and textual content of historical maps. MapReader makes it possible for historians to ask questions of thousands of maps. It was awarded the American Historical Association’s Roy Rosenzweig Prize for Creativity in Digital History in 2023, and is the only software to have ever been honoured with this prize. MapReader first emerged from Living with Machines, and it also now builds on work completed in the Machines Reading Maps project. Machines Reading Maps focused on testing state-of-the-art methods for detecting and recognizing text on maps. A highlight of the project is the dataset of 110 million words found on 57,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection: you can search this dataset and view results at https://www.davidrumsey.com/. 

I continue to work on the legacy of Living with Machines on the new AHRC-funded Data/Culture: Building sustainable communities around Arts and Humanities datasets and tools project, and in particular research applications and community building around MapReader and historical British newspaper datasets.

I completed my PhD in History at Stanford University. Please see [my profile at Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/history/about/people/katherine-mcdonough) for more details.

## Teaching

At Lancaster I teach early modern and modern French history at the undergraduate level and digital humanities at the postgraduate level. Recent courses include "Spatial Technologies for Humanities Research" and "Digital Texts in the Humanities".

I also regularly teach workshops on using computational methods in historical research, especially for maps, newspapers, and encyclopedias.

Previously, I have taught survey courses on early modern European history, world history, and the history of science and technology. I have also taught advanced undergraduate seminars on the French Enlightenment and Revolution, nature and empire in the early modern world, French peasants, and the history of maps and mapping.
